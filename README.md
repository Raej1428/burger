# VIRTUAL BURGER VENDING MACHINE
A delicious Burger menu, where you can see the menu and select menu items and safely eat them... virtually!

Upon opening the application the user should be able to add burgers that they have safely and virtually consumed by clicking the HUNGER time button. 

When the user is full they can click the Take IT I'm FULL button and they will return the burger to the safe to consume list. 

The user can also add a new burger they would like to consume.

Lastly, if they user clicks the delete button they can delete the burger from the database permanently.
